# Don-t_drain_the_brain

The problem it solves-
It helps people understand their mental state. It educates people that, having issues is completely normal, and sharing it reduces the problem. They can cultivate new habits through our 7-day challenge. In the worst case, they can consult any doctor online through our website. All these come in one place and handy to use.

The inspiration behind the idea-
Due to the ongoing pandemic, many have been subjected to strain, stress, panic, no social life, etc. All these have a lot of impact on the brain. So our project is to help such people with mental illness and also to educate people about mental health.
